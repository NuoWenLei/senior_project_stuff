CHECKED - update train sequence to record: 
	* base learner MAE
	* interpreter MAE
	* absolute sum of base learner weight (to determine if magnitude of base learner weight affects interpreter prediction)

- create approach 6:
	* Linear and Dense Combination (Wide and Deep Model)
		* see https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/DNNLinearCombinedRegressor
		* see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07792.pdf
	DONE * individual processing of weights + biases
	DONE * concatenate with embedding
	* perhaps use cos sim between feature embeds
	DONE * use batch norm
