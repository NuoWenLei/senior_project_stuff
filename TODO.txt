- update train sequence to record:
	* base learner MAE
	* interpreter MAE
	* absolute sum of base learner weight (to determine if magnitude of base learner weight affects interpreter prediction)

- create approach 6:
	* individual processing of weights + biases
	* concatenate with embedding
	* perhaps use cos sim between feature embeds
